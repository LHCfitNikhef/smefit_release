=========

Here we collect some representative results that came with the SMEFiT3.0 release. (To be filled)

Reproducing results
-------------------

The runcards that are needed to reproduce the results can be found on the repo through
`this link <https://github.com/LHCfitNikhef/smefit_release/tree/main/runcards/smefit3>`_. We provide runcards split
into the following categories:
 - **fits**: contains runcards to launch fits. This is further subdivided into **smefit_real**, **smefit_projections**,
   and **smefit_uv** for fits to real data, projected data and UV complete models.
 - **projections**: contains runcards to produce projected datasets.
 - **reports**: contains runcards to produce fit reports
