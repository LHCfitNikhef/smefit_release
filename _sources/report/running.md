# Produce a report

Once the file containing the posterior has been produced, the results can be visualized by running a report,
which can be used for both analysing a single fit or comparing results from multiple ones.
The report details have to be specified in a separate runcard, and the report is produced by running

```bash
  smefit R /path/to/report/runcard.yaml
```
All the plots and tables will be stored in a folder and are avialabe both in HTML and pdf.

## Runcard descriprion

Here we describe the various runcard entries that can be set to produce a report.
The runcard is a `.yaml` file where in the first section we specify the input fits we are trying to compare.
All the following entries are **required**.

```yaml
    # report folder name
    name: "report_folder_name"

    # report title
    title: "Comparison between fit 1 and fit 2"

    # fit namen
    result_IDs: [
      "fit_1",
      "fit_2",
    ]

    # fit labels displayed in the plots
    fit_labels: [
      "smefit fit 1",
      "smefit fit 2",
    ]

    # path where the report will be saved
    report_path: path/to/report/
    # path where the reults are located
    result_path: path/to/results/
```

The report will be saved in ``report_path/name`` and will compare the fits having
``result_ID=fit_1`` and ``result_ID=fit_2``,
whose results are therefore saved in ``result_path/fit_1`` and ``result_path/fit_2`` respectively.

In the second part of the report runcard you can specify which kind of plot you want to
include in your report and with which settings.
All the  entries without a value are **optional**, if not present the correspoding analysis/plot will
be skipped.

```

Finally the user has to specify two dictionaries where the informaions about
Wilson coefficients and datasets entering the analysis are reporte are reported.
Both names of the operators and the datasets are those used in the fit runcard.
These informations are **required**.

Wilson coefficients latex names should be added, by group type following
the syntax:

```yaml
coeff_info:
  type1: [
    [Op1, "$c_{\\varphi}^{(1)}$"],
    [Op2, "$c_{\\varphi}^{(2)}$"],
    ...
  ]
  4H: [
    [OQQ1, "$c_{QQ}^{1}$"],
    [OQQ8, "$c_{QQ}^{8}$"],
    ...
  ]
  2L2H: [
    [O81qq, "$c_{qq}^{1,8}$"],
    [O11qq, "$c_{qq}^{1,1}$"],
    ...
  ]
  ...
```

Similarly the information corresponding to the experimental data
should be reported as in the following:

```yaml
data_info:
  group_1: [
    [dataset_1, https://lin/to/public/reference/1],
    [dataset_2, https://lin/to/public/reference/2],
    ...
  ]
  tt13: [
    [CMS_tt_13TeV_ljets_2015_Mtt, https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04191],
    [CMS_tt_13TeV_dilep_2015_Mtt, https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07638],
    [CMS_tt_13TeV_ljets_2016_Mtt, https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08856],
    ...
  ]
  ...
```

You can see the smefit databse repo for futher examples about report runcards.
