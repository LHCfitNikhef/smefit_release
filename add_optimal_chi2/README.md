Files needed to run the fit by adding the FCC-ee optimal observables as an external chi2. 
The fit can be performed by just running interface_oos.py. 
Modify that file to select other runcard, to not include the OOs chi2, to add just some channels or other options. 
Modify the runcard.yaml to fit more or less WCs and select other datasets. 
The .dat files contain the inverse covariance matrix for each channel and energy.
