|SMEFiT| is a Python package for global analyses of particle physics data in the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (|SMEFT|).
The |SMEFT| represents a powerful model-independent framework to constrain, identify,
and parametrize potential deviations with respect to the predictions of the Standard Model (SM).
A particularly attractive feature of the |SMEFT| is its capability to systematically correlate deviations
from the SM between different processes. The full exploitation of the |SMEFT| potential for indirect
New Physics searches from precision measurements requires combining the information provided by the broadest possible dataset,
namely carrying out extensive global analysis which is the main purpose of |SMEFiT|.
