The automation of SMEFT-Assisted Constraints on UV-Complete Model
=================================================================

In this page we collect some additional results on the contrain 
of different UV models meatched to SMEFT as presented in:


- *The automation of SMEFT-Assisted Constraints on UV-Complete Model*,  J. ter Hoeve, G.Magni, J. Rojo, A. N. Rossia and E. Vryonidou :cite:`Smefit_uv`

Using both tree-level and one-loop matching, we derive bounds on a wide range of single- and multi-particle extensions of the SM from a
global dataset composed by LHC and LEP measurements. Whenever possible, we benchmark our results
with existing studies. Our framework realises one of the main objectives of the EFT program in particle
physics: deploying the SMEFT to bypass the need of directly comparing the predictions of UV models
with experimental data
